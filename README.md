# Titanic Project

This project utilizes the Titanic dataset to analyze the survival status of passengers during the sinking of the Titanic. The dataset contains demographic information about the passengers and their conditions on the ship. It serves as a foundational resource for applications in machine learning and data analysis.

## About the Dataset

The Titanic dataset is available on Kaggle and includes the following features:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger's ticket class (1st class, 2nd class, 3rd class)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Passenger's ticket number
- **Fare**: Ticket fare paid by the passenger
- **Cabin**: Cabin number of the passenger
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to understand the factors affecting passengers' survival chances and to make predictions using machine learning algorithms. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling stages.
